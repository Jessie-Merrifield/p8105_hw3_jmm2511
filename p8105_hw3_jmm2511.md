### Problem 2

format the data to use appropriate variable names;

focus on the “Overall Health” topic

include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”

organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
“Excellent”

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_smart2010<-brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic=="Overall Health", 
         response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(response=factor(response, ordered = TRUE, levels=c("Poor","Fair", "Good","Very good","Excellent")))
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

In 2002, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA were observed at 7 or more
locations. In 2010, CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX,
and WA were observed at 7 or more locations

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
 filter(year=="2002") %>% 
 group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
 summarise(n_location=n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(n_location>=7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   locationabbr n_location
    ##   <chr>             <int>
    ## 1 CT                    7
    ## 2 FL                    7
    ## 3 MA                    8
    ## 4 NC                    7
    ## 5 NJ                    8
    ## 6 PA                   10

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
 filter(year=="2010") %>% 
 group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
 summarise(n_location=n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(n_location>=7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 2
    ##    locationabbr n_location
    ##    <chr>             <int>
    ##  1 CA                   12
    ##  2 CO                    7
    ##  3 FL                   41
    ##  4 MA                    9
    ##  5 MD                   12
    ##  6 NC                   12
    ##  7 NE                   10
    ##  8 NJ                   19
    ##  9 NY                    9
    ## 10 OH                    8
    ## 11 PA                    7
    ## 12 SC                    7
    ## 13 TX                   16
    ## 14 WA                   10

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state.

``` r
brfss_excellent<-brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(response=="Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(mean_data_value=mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state
(that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_spaghetti<-
  brfss_excellent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=mean_data_value,color=locationabbr))+
  geom_line()

brfss_spaghetti
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_jmm2511_files/figure-gfm/spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State

``` r
brfss_NY_plot<-
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(locationabbr=="NY", year== c("2006", "2010")) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=data_value, fill=response, color=response ))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(~year)

brfss_NY_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_jmm2511_files/figure-gfm/NY plot-1.png" width="90%" />

### Problem 3

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind)

``` r
nhanes_accel<-read.csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

nhanes_covar<-read.csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv",
                       skip = 4) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age>=21) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    sex=recode(sex, "1"="male", "2"="female"),
    education=recode(education, "1"="Less than high school", "2"="High school equivalent",
                     "3"="More than high school")
  )%>% 
  mutate(
    sex=factor(sex, ordered = TRUE, levels=c("male","female")),
    education=factor(education, ordered = TRUE, c("Less than high school","High school equivalent","More than high school")))

#before joining--excluded participants with less than 21 years of age, those with missing data from nhanes_covar (demographic), and changed sex and education into ordered factors. 

#used left_join to keep the seqn present in the nhanes_covar dataset with 228 obs and a final 1445 variables

nhanes_joined<-
  left_join(nhanes_covar, nhanes_accel, by="seqn")
```

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences
